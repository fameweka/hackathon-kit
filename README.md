# Hackathon Kit

## How it works?

It combines the flexibility of Strapi CMS, DataViz and quick query of Metabase and awesomeness of Postgres database.

It uses docker-compose to have this starter kit run out of the box.

## How to use?

* Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

* Run docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

* Run strapi

```bash
npm run develop
```
